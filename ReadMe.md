I will organize the messy project in next 2 months.
# environment
-  


# structure 
1. `config.py`: parameters of our models
2. `predict.py`: load a trained model, predict for a sample 
3. `state`: use `pickle` to save something generated by our model, like the model states, datasets 
# run  
1. `python train.py` to train the model
